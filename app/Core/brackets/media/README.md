# Media

This packages adds an ability to assign a media to your eloquent models. It uses Spatie's `spatie/laravel-medialibrary`, but it goes a bit further:
- Collections definition - inspired by the conversions definition, we have created Media Collections definition via similar fluent API
- Auto-Process - saving the eloquent model automatically processes and attaches media collections from the request
- Authorization - controls, who has the permission to attach specific medium to specific model
- Private access - controls, who has the permission to view specific medium
